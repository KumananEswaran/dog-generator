### Creates a totally random dog, with a unique name 

## Tech used: ![HTML5 BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=HTML5&color=23555f&style=plastic&logo=html5)![CSS BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=CSS3&color=285f65&style=plastic&logo=css3)![JAVASCRIPT BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript)


Through building a web application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and integrating with the Dog API, I have gained experience in manipulating the DOM, integrating with APIs, randomizing values, and debugging my code. These skills can be applied to future web development projects and have contributed to a well-rounded skill set as a developer.

## Optimizations

When I  improve this project, I would consider adding new features that enhance the application's functionality or value to users. For example, I would add the ability to filter dogs by temperament, activity level or size, or allow users to save their favorite dogs to a list.

## Lessons Learned:

Making requests to the API using JavaScript's fetch() method, handling the API's responses using promises, and parsing data from the responses using JSON.
Randomizing values using JavaScript's Math.random() method
